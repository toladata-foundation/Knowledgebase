# Preparing for TolaData

---

At its core, TolaData requires teams to have a strong foundation for monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\), have program management in place and practices/processes established that promote data quality. Depending on the current capacity of the country team, the preparation to be TolaData ready, prior to actually rolling out the system, can be the bulk of the work. This would include supporting teams to improve their M&E and program management practices.

This guidance is broken up into three tiers: minimum requirements, best practices, and a self assessment.

* Tier I: Minimum requirements, are those things that must be in place before a country is ready for a rollout of TolaData.

* Tier II: Best practices, is a list of tools, practices, and skillsets that make a country better prepared and equipped for adoption of the TolaData system.

* Tier III: Organization Self-Assessment, is a set of questions to assess the current state of a country’s processes, procedures, and capacity, and what type of support a country will need for rollout.

These three tiers of “readiness” will help the TolaData team make decisions about how a roll out plan might need to be adapted for a specific country team, and what kind of support will be required to ensure a successful implementation of the system.

## TIER I: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

* Organizational leadership buy-in including by program managers and M&E leads.
* Commitment of staff time dedicated to preparations to go-live and post-training support.

Funding / resources allocated for M&E staff and any additional in-country resources needed for implementation and support.

## TIER II: BEST PRACTICES

While best practices are not mandatory for TolaData, some organizations have found that adopting these practices can help prepare teams to be more equipped and ready to take advantage of closer integration with their data workflow.

* **Digital Data Collection:** the use of digital data collection tools as applicable and relevant, authoring XLS forms, and adoption of third-party service provider like [Ona](https://ona.io/) or [Kobo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/).
* **Cloud-based document storage:** documents are accessible in a digital format within a standard folder structure for retaining documents and basic understanding of tools like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/).
* **Adopting common **[**Program Management practices**](http://www.pm4ngos.com/the-guide-to-the-pmd-pro/): We recommend that applicable positions be PMD Pro certified.
* **Standard indicators** are in use for existing programs where relevant and included in new proposals \(alongside budgets for proper measurement and collection\).
* **Standard collection and monitoring tools:** data collection tools \(recording and reporting tools\) in any format \(paper or digital\), standard formats for logframes or indicator plans. 
* **Standard organizational-level key performance indicators \(KPI\):** KPIs that can be aggregated across multiple programs M&E and ICT/IM requirements and responsibilities are articulated in all key positions \(program, program quality, M&E, operations, etc\).
* **M&E and data quality:** is prioritized as part of organizational strategies or annual plans

Having the above mentioned qualities will help your team become successful TolaData champions!
