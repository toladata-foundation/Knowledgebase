## Core Products of TolaData

### Activity: Project Management Tool

**Standardization alongside adaptability**

* A standard set of forms to capture the full data lifecycle of a program, integrating tools like logframe and work-breakdown structures.
* Each stage of a project is tracked on TolaActivity dashboards, allowing managers and staff to see progress at a glance.
* Primary forms are supplemented by flexible monitoring forms like training attendance or beneficiary registration.

**Transparency through traceable results**

* The Indicator tracking tool creates indicators at activity, output, outcome, and goal level for each program.
* Progress against each indicator is documented through data sets from digital data collection tools or a consolidator like TolaTrack.
* Ability to trace evidence-base, view targets vs. actuals, and analyze cost benefit / value for money.

**Modular approach to management**

* Each program activity can be linked to a multitude of connecting modules including budget management, procurement, staffing, stakeholders, and geo locations.
* This allows for data linking and reporting across different regions, programs, and activities.

### Track: Data Management Tool

**Digital data collection**

* Developed in-house, our digital data collection application has an integrated form builder and option for QR reader to upload paper forms.
* A standardized form library as well as a custom form builder ensures that the exact data collection tool is available for every project.

**Data analysis**

* TolaTrack can integrate data from multiple platforms and provide merge/append, auto-export, data cleaning, editing, sharing and analysis features.
* This allows users to collate multiple data silos into one while maintaining the data stream.

**Data integration**

* Directly integrates with mobile data collection platforms such as ONA or Kobo Toolbox to provide users with access to all of their forms and data for import and management.
* Data can be easily exported to other data platforms or tools, into Google Sheets or downloaded as any number of file types including csv or xls.

**Open data**

* All data throughout our platform is readily accessible and easily shareable in a public repository or privately with other users.
