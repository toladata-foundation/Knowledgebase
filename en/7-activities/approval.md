### Use case 
Add approvals allows the system to `Assign`, `Request` approvals for an activity or project. Once an approval is initiated, the system notifies the `Assigned User` to approve based on their approval authority limit. These limits can be set by the `Program Admin` role and be based on existing finance approvals used by the Organization. Approvals can help inform which activities or projects are ready for implementation.

> **Quick Tip:** 
Not all approvals have to be financial based. For example, a user from the Monitoring and Evaluation \(M&E\) team may be asked to approve an Indicator before data is collected whereas a Program Manager may be requested to approve the Activity before it is initiated.
