Please note that you can always go back to the specific sections to add or edit your program details. So donâ€™t worry if you are not able to complete all the data fields now.

### Add activities/tasks 

Next you might want to add activities to your program. Select the `Activities` tab on the Navigation bar and click on the orange `+` button or type your new activity directly in the `+ Add Tasks` bar. Then, feel free to drag, drop and rearrange your tasks and activities as necessary.
