### What is a Program?

A **program** is defined as a group of related projects and or activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available through managing them individually.

Most program details can be found in program proposals and concept notes developed in your program's proposal development and setup and planning phases. 

Here's an example of how `programs`, `projects` and `activities` can be broken down:

### Adding a new program

To add a new program for your team or organization, go to the Programs tab and click `Add New Program`. Start by adding your Program Name, Start date, and End date. Click `Submit` and you're all set!

From here you will prompted to the Program Guide to help you start adding information about your program in the following sections:

* Sectors;

* Results Framework;

* Indicators;

* Any Project Forms that you would be using for collecting data and tracking your indicators.

> **Quick Tip:** 
1. Donâ€™t worry if you cannot complete all the details here! You can always go back later to complete any of the sections at your own pace. :relaxed:
2. Come back to the Program Guide by simply clicking on the three dots icon, accessible from the Programs tab in every program's row.
