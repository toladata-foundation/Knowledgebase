# Build your Results Framework
---

### Adding levels to the results framework

1. Define the overall program goal. Add its title and an optional description.

2. Create branches from the overall program goal and define the next set of `Level` names \(I.e. Outcome, Output, Activity\) and its `Description` statements.

3. Continue this process until all your levels are defined and your program results are clearly outlined.
