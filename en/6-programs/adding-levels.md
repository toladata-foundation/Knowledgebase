# Build your Results Framework
---



**Adding levels to the results framework:**

1. Define the overall program goal. This includes determining the `Level` name \(I.e. Goal\) and a `Description` statement.

2. Create branches from the overall program goal and define the next set of `Level` names \(I.e. Outcome, Output, Activity\) and its `Description` statements.

3. Continue this process until all your levels are defined and your program results are clearly outlined.
