#### What is a milestone?
Milestones are markers that you can use to identify key accomplishments throughout the life of your program. One use case for milestones is to mark the start and end of a program phase as below:

#### Why is it important?
Milestones can help us break the program lifecycle into phases making it easier to see how a program progresses over time. With Milestones, the system will be able to summarize all program activities that are completed during the defined milestone start and end dates.

#### Adding milestones
To add milestones:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Milestones` section.
2. Click, `Add a Milestone`.
3. Add your milestone Name, Start Date, End Date (required). Additionally, you can add a Description.
