# Collect Data Against Indicators
---

There are two ways for you to link your results data evidence to indicators to track progress. However, **it is still possible to simply enter the collected value manually, without the need to back it up with evidence**.

### Add any data stored on Google Drive
Click on the `Collected data` icon, and link any data you store on Google Drive to your indicator on TolaData. You will be asked to authorize TolaData to use your Google Drive first. Collected value will have to be inserted manually, so make sure you're entering the correct number! Use this method to add text documents like contracts or MoUs with partners, or even pictures and other visual data.

### Add tabular data stored in Track

Indicator results can now be automated through Track without the need for manual updates! No need to spend hours collating indicator data from various sources for donor reporting.

Select data points or columns from your evidence data table in Track to perform calculations like summation/average etc. to automatically populate your indicator results field. This method ensures  error free data entry and accuracy of indicator results. Use it for any tabular data you collect for your projects and programs.
