#### Practice

**Register with TolaData** at [https://demo.toladata.io](https://demo.toladata.io)**\*** \[Opens an external website in a new tab\] and have a browse through your profile.

You’ll see which level of permission you’ve been granted once your Admin assigns programs to you \(you'll be able to check that under Team tab of a Program of your choice\).
