# Train your team members step by step

---

Now that you are all set to use TolaData, you can teach your team how to use it! Let's get you started.

## Trainer's role

Trainer's scope of responsibilities will differ significantly between organizations, depending on their size and TolaData use cases. We can, however, define a generic set of trainer's tasks that you can pick and choose from, to fit your needs.

#### Assess what is there to be done

The following factors are worth considering while preparing for the training:

1. Who are your learners?
Before you start working with a team, you need to understand their strengths, weaknesses and needs. For TolaData training, we're using the following [assessment form](https://enketo.ona.io/x/#p91m) [redirects to an external website]. This helps us adjust the training to the participants' level of expectations. You'll find an XLS form with this survey in the Resources section below. Feel free to adapt it and use it for your practice. 
2. Why do you want them to learn a new skill?
It is crucial to understand and communicate, why your training is happening. No one engages eagerly in activities they deem pointless and you don't want to loose their or your time, either. 
3. What do they need to learn?
Departing from your understanding of participants' background and the ultimate goal you want to accomplish, define the scope of your training. Customization is the key - teach only what people need to know for their job function and role. You might want to split the group based on that.
4. What is the expected benefit to both your learners and the organization?
Anticipate resistance and act: be prepared to speak to how TolaData benefits to [funders](https://www.toladata.com/dashboard-for-funders/), [project managers](https://www.toladata.com/project-managers-ngo/) and [senior managers](https://www.toladata.com/senior-managers-ngos/) [redirects to TolaData website].
5. What resources do you need to deliver the training?
And last but not least, think about the logistics: format (online, in person), time, room (projector, sitting arrangement), internet connection, possibly travel and accommodation.

#### Prepare the training

##### Planning
Once you have a clear vision of what you want to do, why and how, it's time to do some planning. Look up examples of TolaData [training agendas that we prepared for different training formats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJvaVOyblWtPHQ7ibz0IcuOCIhEMKgx1533Dv05o1Q4/edit?usp=sharing) (self paced, online facilitated and in person trainings) as well as training [slidedeck you can use to provide training on all TolaData components](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pz6IB3Zwb8efOgXvi8gZ-w8E_NoyHzXPoTkrn5vt_zo) [redirects to an external website]. Remember: everyone wants to see the system, so start with demoing TolaData to your team as soon as possible in the training.

##### Engagement
Once you've decided which training format fits your needs best, you'd like to diversify your online or offline meetings, so that they're both a efficient and pleasant meeting. For in person training, feel free to use [these energizers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HohufUBEUc8vqR-C93TL8-36AKNOlFI2QuX3i9XYoms/edit?usp=sharing) [redirects to an external website]. In online facilitated classes it is crucial to check in with your participants often, to make sure they're focused and on track. You might also want to use engagement tools, like surveys, voting or raising hands that are provided by most online conference tools.

##### Feedback
Want to know how it went? Don't forget to ask your trainees for opinion! Consult [TolaData training evaluation](/enketo.ona.io/x/#phzR) form and play around with its XLS form in the Resources section. For in person trainings, you might want to consider regular feedback sharing and sessions at the end of the training to identify possible pitfalls and areas to improve.   

#### Conduct the training

OK, so you've prepared and now intend to implement the training as planned. You have all the relevant materials in place, the internet is working, and even the coffee tastes good. What could go wrong? Well, be prepared for unexpected and to change the agenda according to the participants' needs. Be ready to stop and clarify on open issues. In both in person and online classes you might want to secure a co-trainer to help you attend to individual questions or to support trainees who are lagging behind. 

#### Provide ongoing, on request support for the team

The training is finished, but your work is not. Your trainees will get back to you with any questions regarding the system, issues or product enhancement ideas. Think of a convenient way to address their requests - do you want to set up a group on some messanger, or use your intranet for it? It's up to you, but your trainees need to know where to go when in trouble. 

##### Invite team members to TolaData

You might conduct the training on the [demo site](https://demo.toladata.io/) [redirects to an external website], but eventually you want everyone to use your production site. Send all your team members invitation to TolaData! Ask them to login to. Then add them to your program team.
