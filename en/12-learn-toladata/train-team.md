# Train your team members step by step

---

Now that you are all set to use TolaData, you can teach your team how to use it! Let's get you started.

## Trainer's role

Trainer's scope of responsibilities will differ significantly between organizations, depending on their size and TolaData use cases. We can, however, define a generic set of trainer's tasks that you can pick and choose from, to fit your needs.

#### Assess what is there to be done

The following factors are worth considering while preparing for the training:

1. Who are your learners?
Before you start working with a team, you need to understand their strengths, weaknesses and needs. For TolaData training, we're using the following [assessment form](https://enketo.ona.io/x/#p91m) [redirects to an external website]. This helps us adjust the training to the participants' level of expectations. You'll find an XLS form with this survey in the Resources section below. Feel free to adapt it and use it for your practice. 
2. Why do you want them to learn a new skill?
It is crucial to understand and communicate, why your training is happening. No one engages eagerly in activities they deem pointless and you don't want to loose their or your time, either. 
3. What do they need to learn?
Departing from your understanding of participants' background and the ultimate goal you want to accomplish, define the scope of your training. Customization is the key - teach only what people need to know for their job function and role. You might want to split the group based on that.
4. What is the expected benefit to both your learners and the organization?
Anticipate resistance and act: be prepared to speak to how TolaData benefits to [funders](https://www.toladata.com/dashboard-for-funders/), [project managers](https://www.toladata.com/project-managers-ngo/) and [senior managers](https://www.toladata.com/senior-managers-ngos/) [redirects to TolaData website].
5. What resources do you need to deliver the training?
And last but not least, think about the logistics: format (online, in person), time, room (projector, sitting arrangement), internet connection, possibly travel and accommodation.

#### Plan the training: engagement, experience and feedback

Once you have a clear vision of what you want to do, why and how, it's time to do some planning. Look up examples of TolaData [training agendas that we prepared for different training formats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJvaVOyblWtPHQ7ibz0IcuOCIhEMKgx1533Dv05o1Q4/edit?usp=sharing) (self paced, online facilitated and in person trainings) as well as training [slidedeck you can use to provide training on all TolaData components](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pz6IB3Zwb8efOgXvi8gZ-w8E_NoyHzXPoTkrn5vt_zo) [redirects to an external website].

Once you've decided which training format fits your needs best, you'd like to diversify your online or offline meetings, so that they're both a efficient and pleasant meeting. For in person training, feel free to use [these energizers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HohufUBEUc8vqR-C93TL8-36AKNOlFI2QuX3i9XYoms/edit?usp=sharing) [redirects to an external website]. In online facilitated classes it is crucial to check in with your participants often, to make sure they're focused and on track. You might also want to use engagement tools, like surveys, voting or raising hands that are provided by most online conference tools.

Want to know how it went? Don't forget to ask your trainees for opinion! Consult [TolaData training evaluation](/enketo.ona.io/x/#phzR) form and play around with it's XLS form in the Resources section.

## Why TolaData?

'Why TolaData' is a question you will have answer when you try to onboard your team to start using TolaData. Here are a couple of pointers to keep in mind when trying to demonstration the value of TolaData.

Benefits of using TolaData:

* End-to-end solution for your program management process. You don't have to worry about using different tools to manage all your program and monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\) data. TolaData provides an end-to-end solution for your entire program life cycle and manage the workflow process.

* _Traceability and accessibility of program data._ Remember how every time you have to report to donors or senior management you have struggle to look for program progress data? Now all your program data are neatly aligned with measurable indicators and progress tracking indicator results is just click away! Your survey and monitoring data are also traceable directly to your indicator results.

* Flexible to integrate with existing system. If you are in the development sector for a long time, chances are you are already using many of the data management and monitoring tools. TolaData offers easy integration with any tools with external API so your data can be easily migrated from existing system.

* Community led.TolaData uses a bottom up approach in designing the platform. It focuses on gathering feedback and enhancement requests directly from the users by maintaining an open user community to engage with each other.
