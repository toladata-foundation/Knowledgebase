# Feedback and Support

---

Let's face it we all have great ideas, but sometimes there are so many great ideas, we need more than one person to provide input on it. That's why we ask you to discuss your ideas and vote!

### Feedback on the training material

Whenever you find something unclear or simply feel like sharing your thoughts, use inline comment to express yourself! This is how to do it:

### Feedback on the TolaData application

Here's how to share your requests or add a ticket:

### **What is a ticket?**

A ticket could be a report on a specific issue or a problem you are having using the software, or it could be you have a request for an enhancement to the software. All the tickets are reviewed, tagged, and prioritized by the TolaData team.

### **How best to enter a ticket**

When entering tickets there are basic questions you can answer, to help us understand the issues described in the ticket.

* What browser are you using?

* What, if any, error message did you get?

* What did you expect to happen?

* What actually happened?

An example of a ticket lacking the details we need is,

> "I found an error when I was working in TolaData."

The problem with this kind of ticket is, it's hard for us to know where to start troubleshooting without contacting you for more information.

An example of a **good ticket** is:

> "When I click the submit button on the new Indicator page for Program XYZ,  I get this error....
>
> I have pasted below the error message and the page URL where I found the error."

With that amount of detail in a ticket, we are able to start working on a solution right away. You can also attach a screenshot of the page you seeing error in.

To help when entering a Feature Request or Enhancement, focus on the business problem and priority of the request,  not the solution, so our developers can focus on the correct path, to add the requested features.

### **Three types of tickets you can submit**

The types help us prioritize the work queue.

#### **Problems**

Choose problem when you are requesting help with something you are having an issue with, but you can still get your task done.

#### **Errors/Bugs**

Choose Error/Bugs if you receive an error or if there is unexpected behavior, especially when you cannot finish your task!

#### **Enhancements**

Anything you or your colleague would like to see added or changed, but is not broken!

### Our work queue

The TolaData team monitors the tickets daily. Problems, such as bugs in the software, are usually fixed in the next release of our software.

We will be directly in touch with you with questions regarding your ticket. Requests for enhancements to the software require more feedback from other TolaData users before we can assign our software developers to the ticket.
