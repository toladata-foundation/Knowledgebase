<p> 1. Are you happy about how projects are currently managed at your organization? </p>
- [x] Absolutely! We're quick, efficient and successful at making a difference. 
- [x] So-so. We manage to achieve our goals, but it comes at too great a cost.
- [x] We're terrible at organizing our work. A lot of resources are lost along the way.

> Great to hear that! You might still want to consult the resources below to get inspired by PMD Pro approach.

> Take a look at what PMD Pro has to offer. Maybe it can help you increase your efficiency?

> Why don't you study PMD Pro and see how this approach could be implemented at your organization?  

<p> 2. Why is PMD Pro beneficial to non-profits worldwide? </p>
- [x] It offers a structured approach to projects delivery and tracking, making it easier for organizations to report on results and get funding.
- [ ] It's easy to adopt by any organization.
- [ ] Many prominent donors require their grantees to use PMD Pro for the programs and projects funded by them.

> And not only that! PMD Pro helps you structure your day-to-day work and make the most of your field experiences and lessons learned.

> You wish! Adopting rigorous PMD Pro might be a challenge, especially for inexperienced organizations. If you're afraid you won't be able to implement it fully, we suggest to start small and gradually add more PMD Pro elements to your practice.

> That would definitely help this approach spread out, but it's not required by donors. Yet.

<p> 3. What is the most challenging part of your project management and M&E work? </p>
- [x] Project planning and setup. I struggle to plan my work realistically and later deliver the expected results. 
- [x] Project implementation. There is always something getting into my way.
- [x] Indicator tracking. I'm finding it difficult to collect and analyze my data.
- [x] Reporting and fundraising. I'm finding it difficult to put together a compelling story that speaks to prospective donors.

> PMD Pro and TolaData come hand in hand to help you with that!

> We cannot control unexpected realities out there. But we're in charge of how we deal with them. PMD Pro suggests a balanced approach to risk management, you might find it inspiring!
TolaData is your solution for neat data collection and analyzing indicator results in real time.

> You are only able to report on as much as you've kept track on throughout your project. Once you have your indicator plan in place and collect data on regular basis, TolaData will come in handy to help you meet your deadlines and donors!
