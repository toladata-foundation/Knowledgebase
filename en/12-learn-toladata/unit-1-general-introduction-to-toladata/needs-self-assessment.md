<question> 
<p>I am familiar with and/or use digital data collection tools, like Ona or Kobo Toolbox.</p>
<answer correct>Yes</answer>  
<answer>No</answer>
<explanation>Ona and KoboToolbox are digital data collection tools for you to create and manage your surveys. These tools, along with any application with an external API, easily integrate with TolaData to directly link survey data to the system to generate reports and dashboards real-time. Digital forms are very useful for teams to collect data in the field directly from beneficiaries. This provides transparency and promotes evidence based decision making. </explanation>

<question> 
<p>I am familiar with and/or use tabular and relational data structures within the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) team.</p>
<answer correct>Yes</answer>  
<answer>No</answer>
<explanation>It is very helpful to have your datasets in tabular form which means having all your data in either Excel, relational database, or a web based database. This can help you not only to easily manage and analyze your data but also to import your existing datasets to TolaData directly. Talk to your M&E manager to see how you can transition your data to a basic Excel based form to start with and later moving to relational and web based softwares.</explanation>
