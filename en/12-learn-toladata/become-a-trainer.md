In this section you'll find a selection of software training best practices based on our experience. Feel inspired!

#### Get real
1. Base training on individual roles and real life use scenarios. Teach only what they need to know and provide additional resources for the curious;
2. Put the new tool in a broader context, link to existing business processes and organization needs;
11. Use natural language instead of subject matter jargon;
12. Make the learning environment resemble the work \(application\) environment. Training should be [hands-on, based on real life examples and tasks, practical \(learning by doing](http://elearninguncovered.com/2015/09/three-tips-for-teaching-successful-software-training-classes/)\);






2. Engage the learners and let them practice; ### Make the training for your trainees and the organization, not someone else
3. Assess the needs and sills and actively seek their feedback to adjust your training accordingly;
6. Assess what people start with and design the training accordingly;
8. Identify agents of change





#### Engage
7. The more you engage your trainees in the training design process, the more successful it will be;
2. Engage the learners and let them practice; 

#### Be agile
9. Start small- train one team or department, evaluate and only then train larger groups;

#### Be f




14. Make it short and sweet, don’t take too much of your participants’ time;

15. Make it collaborative - provide space for peer feedback \(with very clear criteria\), questions and discussions as it raises user engagement;

16. Regardless of a method \(internal trainer, external support, automated\), provide ongoing support, explanation and guidance on how to perform each task and participate in course in general \(eg how to use the training software\);



18. People learn best when they are allowed space to make and correct their own mistakes. Provide test environment;

19. Continuously ask for feedback from users;

20. Keep all materials accessible and in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/);

Keep the training gender responsive \(use gender sensitive language and make sure Ts represent different genders equally\).
