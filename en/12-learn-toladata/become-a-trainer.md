#### Teaching new software to adult learners

Below you'll find a handful of best practices that we've gathered throughout our training practice to help you design a process for your team.

1. **Base training on individual roles and real life use scenarios**

1. dsfs

2. fsfs

3.

2. **Engage the learners and let them practice**

3. **Get their feedback**

4. **Overview onboarding followed by a self-study learning \(knowledgebase\)**

5. Put the new tool in a broader context, link to existing business processes and organization needs;
6. Continuously assess the needs and skills people start with and design the training accordingly;

7. Qualitative data showed thatpeer networking, engagement of stakeholdersin organizations’ capacity building decision making, andinternal task sharingbolstered organizations’ ability to improve capacity [\[see source\]](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/19518);

8. Identify agents of change\(future Ts or go-to people in the organization\);

9. Start small- train one team or department, evaluate and only then train larger groups;

10. Customize trainingto use cases and job functions - teach only the relevant stuff;

11. Use natural language instead of subject matter jargon;

12. Make the learning environment resemble the work \(application\) environment. Training should be [hands-on, based on real life examples and tasks, practical \(learning by doing](http://elearninguncovered.com/2015/09/three-tips-for-teaching-successful-software-training-classes/)\);

13. Give different options for absorbing the same content \(video/text/checklist/discussion/easily accessible knowledge base etc\);

14. Make it short and sweet, don’t take too much of your participants’ time;

15. Make it collaborative - provide space for peer feedback \(with very clear criteria\), questions and discussions as it raises user engagement;

16. Regardless of a method \(internal trainer, external support, automated\), provide ongoing support, explanation and guidance on how to perform each task and participate in course in general \(eg how to use the training software\);

17. Startwith general presentation of features \(don’t leave people overwhelmed with new functions\);

18. People learn best when they are allowed space to make and correct their own mistakes. Provide test environment;

19. Continuously ask for feedback from users;

20. Keep all materials accessible and in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/);

Keep the training gender responsive \(use gender sensitive language and make sure Ts represent different genders equally\).
