# Linking indicators to program objectives
---
Program progress is often tracked by linking them to specific set of program objectives. Achievement and progress of these objectives are tracked by measuring the progress of indicators linked to these objectives. For example:

| Program Objectives | Indicators |
| :--- | :--- |
| Objective 1: Promote modern agriculture cultivation techniques | Number of farmers trained on new agriculture techniques |
|  | Number of farmers using new agriculture techniques |
> **Quick Tip:**   
> Find your Program Objectives with their linked indicators also under the Programs tab. Access your most relevant indicators directly from the Programs tab, where they're stored along your basic program data. Still, you might choose to review all your indicators here, under the Indicators tab.
