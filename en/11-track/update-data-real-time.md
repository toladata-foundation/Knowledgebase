### Auto-pull data from source

You can set up auto-pull, to pull in any new data from your Ona, Google Sheets or a JSON feeds.

To turn on Auto-Pull you need to go to your Table's view page and click on the Data Sources tab. Mind that you can only set Auto-Pull frequency for those data sets that get updated (and not for CSV or JSON files).

> **Quick Tip:**   
> It is possible to update data manually at any time, simply by clicking on `Update Data` button under `Options` tab.
