# Auto-pull Datasets
---
You can set up auto-pull, to pull in any new data from your Ona, Google Sheets or a JSON feeds on specified frequencies.
#### **Turn on Auto-pull**

To turn on Auto-pull you need to go to your Table's view page and click on the Data Sources tab. Mind that you can only set Auto-Pull frequency for those data sets that get updated (not for CSV or JSON files).

> **Quick Tip:**   
> Assign a unique column in your Table to avoid duplication of records. A unique column (usually a User ID number or other value that is unique to a single record) will ensure that only new data is added to your Table when you turn on auto-pull or choose to manually update a table in Track. Choose your unique column and hit `Save`.
