#### Program

A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available through managing them individually.

#### Project

A set of activities meeting agreed on objectives in a specific period of time with an agreed set of resources.

#### Results Framework

A results framework is a graphical display or matrix of the different levels of results expected from a particular program. The results comprise of the longer-term objectives ('outcomes' or 'impact') and the intermediate outcomes and outputs.

#### Tola

We mean 'complete data' when we use this Pashtun word for 'all' or 'complete'.

#### Track app

**Track**, TolaData’s database management toolkit, enables you to easily consolidate multiple data sources for timely analysis.

#### Unique columns

A unique column is any column in your table within Track that does not have the same data in any of its rows; each row in the column is unique and does not repeat. For example, User IDs or Serial Numbers are good examples of unique data. Tables imported from services like Ona will usually have a column called uu\_id which is a universal unique id. The uu-id column is a great column to set as your unique column. Assigning a unique column in Tables will ensure that only new data is added to your Table when you turn on auto-pull or choose to manually update a table in Track.
