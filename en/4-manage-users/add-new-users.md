### Login to TolaData

With the [**TolaData login**](https://activity.toladata.io) users can sign up to access the TolaData platform.

There are a few ways a user can sign on:   
**Single Sign-on \(SSO\) options:**

* Google
* Office 365

**Register a Tola Account**

1. If you prefer not to use single sign-on via Office 365, we have the option for users to register a TolaData account by going to: [https://api.toladata.io/accounts/register/](https://api.toladata.io/accounts/register/)
2. Fill out the registration form and under the `Org` field, enter the name of the organization that your user should be associated with and we'll ping the Org Administrator about it.

### Add User to a Program

Once they've signed up, select the program you want to add them to and go the teams section. Once there, click on `Add Existing Team Member` to add relevant team member from the dropdown menu.

### Configuring Team

### Change Team Roles

It's easy to assign different permission levels to each member of your team. You must be designated as a `Program Admin` in order to change Team Member roles.

There are three types of user roles in the system:

* `Program Admin`
* `Program Team`
* `Program View Only`
