### Adding Indicators

Add your indicators under one of previously created Results Framework levels, or leave them unassigned. You can always change it later.

1. To add an indicator, click an orange `+` button and fill out the fields. Mind that only your indicator name and LOP (Life of program) Target are required fields.
2. To save your indicator, hit `Submit`.

### Linking indicators to program objectives

Program progress is often tracked by linking them to specific set of program objectives. Achievement and progress of these objectives are tracked by measuring the progress of indicators linked to these objectives. For example:

| Program Objectives | Indicators |
| :--- | :--- |
| Objective 1: Promote modern agriculture cultivation techniques | Number of farmers trained on new agriculture techniques |
|  | Number of farmers using new agriculture techniques |
> **Quick Tip:**   
> Find your Program Objectives with their linked indicators also under the Programs tab. Access your most relevant indicators directly from the Programs tab, where they're stored along your basic program data. Still, you might choose to review all your indicators here, under the Indicators tab. 

Here's how to link program objectives to indicators:
