### What is an Indicator?

An **indicator** is a quantitative measure or qualitative observation used to describe change. 

Indicators are linked to the objectives set in a Program Logframe to help measure the success and achievement of the said objectives. Indicators depict the extent to which a project is accomplishing its planned inputs, outputs, outcomes and goals.

For an indicator to measure change it must have:

* Baseline: a measure or description of current performance of the entity and/or a comparator. Baselines must be defined at or near the beginning of a project. 
* Target: the improvements, change or achievement expected to happen during project implementation.



### Creating SMART indicators

When developing indicators, the norm is to use SMART criteria to guide performance indicator conceptualization. SMART is:

| **S**pecific | Indicators must be quantifiable and measurable? What does the project intend to change? |
| :--- | :--- |
| **M**easurable | The indicator must be quantifiable and measurable. Can the indicator be assessed objectively and independently? |
| **A**chievable | Indicators must be attainable within the constraints of the project triangle \(budget/resources, time/budget, and scope/quality\). |
| **R**elevant | Indicators must accurately measure the change the project aspires to generate. Does the indicator practical and cost-effectively measure what the project team needs to know? |
| **T**ime-bound | The indicator should identify a specific time and date. By when will the indicator be achieved? Can the indicator be achieved within the established timeframe? |

### Basic Indicator Plan Format

| Indicator name | Definition | Data collection sources and methods | Frequency of data collection | Person\(s\) responsible | Method of analysis | Information use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   | WHAT will be monitored | HOW it will be monitored | WHEN it will be monitored | WHO will monitor | HOW it will be analyzed | WHY it is monitored |
