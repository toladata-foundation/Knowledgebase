### Adding Documents

1. To add a module, click an orange `+` button and select `Documents`.
2. To add a document from your `Google Drive`, simply click on the `Google Drive` button and select a desired file. You will have to authorize TolaData to use your Google Drive the first time you do it.

### Use case
Possible examples of documents for your program activity can be Terms of Reference \(ToR\), Memorandum of Understanding \(MoUs\), Program or activity budget or even pictures and other field activity documentation. This helps to organize your program documents in one place and provides direct link and evidence for your activities.
