# What is a Report?
---

Automatically generated reports will help get a quick understanding of where you're at with your programs and activities. 

The first view will give you an understanding of your Projects/Activities statuses as well as provide an overview of sectors that your indicators belong to.

> **Quick Tip:** Unless you want to see a list of all your programs, you can use a global filter to display only the relevant one for clarity.

Click on a selected color to dig deeper into activities that are falling behind or doing great.

You will be taken to the next 'Projects' tab, that displays data about your Projects/Activities. You can easily remove the filter to display all Projects/Activities, regardless of their status. Below you'll see budget consumption for each of them displayed in a bar chart.

Indicators tab provides an insight into your indicator results. Navigate there to get a quick visual understanding of how your indicators are progressing against targets on a bar chart at the bottom of page or hit the blue `View` button to dig deeper into where those results come from by reviewing collected data.
