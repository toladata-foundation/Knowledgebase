# What is a Dashboard?
---
Dashboard is a custom report you can create yourself to get a quick understanding of the current status of selected aspects of your Program, Project/Activity, Indicator or other data point. Keep it to yourself or share across the organization (make it `Public in the organization` while creating a new dashboard or editing it). Dashboards are fully customizable,  

Go to `Dashboards` tab on the navigation bar.
