#Mobile Data Collection

---

Digital Data Collection, is the use of electronic devices from low-end mobile phones to notebooks, to simplify the collection of data in the field. It can turn out as being very useful to the M&E specialist or program manager when collecting and organizing data for an evaluation.

#### Before you start: Hardware and software requirements
In order to collect data on a mobile device, you'll need a mobile device (mobile phone, tablet or notebook) with data collection software, for example, an app or a website that you access through a browser. Many mobile data collection tools, TolaData's built-in form builder included, operate in offline mode.

#### Factors to consider: Is mobile data collection the right choice for me?

* **Data needs**: Digital data collection is good for quantitative data collection and less for qualitative data such as long texts from interviews or focus groups.
* **Connectivity**: Network coverage may not be important when collecting the data but it is when it comes to transmitting the data to a central database.
* **Consider device quality**: Do your research about which devices are compatible with your data collection applications before you invest. Therefore it is important for you to think if the devices you purchase can be used for projects in the future.
* **Data protection and security**: Be aware of the data you are collecting (for example, personally identifiable information) and take extra precautions by password protecting and actively keep permission settings up to date.

#### Advantages: Why use mobile data collection tools?

* **Design the survey** following the needs of a project
* **Easier to manage the data collection process** through real-time submissions
* **Reduces costs** associated with printing, form transportation, cleansing tasks
* **Reduces labor** by cutting the double entry of data by having to digitalize the data captured by pen on paper in the field
* **Easier to enter and aggregate data**
* **Easier to carry out** subsequent **data reviews** and **cleansing tasks**
* **Increases data safety** as it eliminates risks of paper forms being lost, stolen or seen by unauthorized persons

##### Some examples:

1) **Catholic Relief Services** have been able to **cut the labor in half** in conducting seed affairs, by using touch devices and barcode technology identify beneficiary and seed vendors and track the exchange of goods.

2) **Pact** in Namibia wanted to conduct an evaluation of capacity development with partners during their project. Mobile technology facilitated the collection of the evaluation of data by allowing to **design** the appropriate survey for the task, by giving the chance for **data upload by the ones collecting it** and lastly by **making the data collection very fast**: it was available one week later for the required analysis and report.

#### In practice: What good applications/platforms allow you to do?

* Enter data in an offline mode;
* Transmit data automatically to a central database once a communication network is available;
* Validate data as it's entered;
* Remember previously entered data to reduce the complexity of data entry;
* Collect multiple forms of data: photographs, voice recordings, GPS coordinates etc.
