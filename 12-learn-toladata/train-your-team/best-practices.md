   3. 

2. **Engage the learners and let them practice**

3. **Get their feedback**

4. **Overview onboarding followed by a self study microlearning \(knowledgebase\)**

5. Put the new tool in a broader context, link to existing business processes and company/organization needs;

6. Continuously assess the needs and skills people start with and design the training accordingly;

7. Qualitative data showed thatpeer networking,engagement of stakeholdersin organizations’ capacity building decision making, andinternal task sharingbolstered organisations’ ability to improve capacity[\[see source\]](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/19518);

10. Customize trainingto use cases and job functions - teach only the relevant stuff;

11. Usenatural languageinstead of subject matter jargon;

12. Make thelearning environmentresemble the work \(application\) environment. Training should be h[ands-on, based on real life examples and tasks, practical \(learning by doing](http://elearninguncovered.com/2015/09/three-tips-for-teaching-successful-software-training-classes/)\);;

13. Givedifferent optionsfor absorbing the same content \(video/text/checklist/discussion/easily accessible knowledge base etc\);

14. Make itshort and sweet, don’t take too much of your participants’ time;

15. Make itcollaborative- provide space for peer feedback \(with very clear criteria\), questions and discussions as it raises user engagement;

16. Regardless of a method \(internal trainer, external support, automated\), provide ongoingsupport, explanation and guidanceon how to perform each task and participate in course in general \(eg how to use the training software\);

17. Startwith general presentation of features \(don’t leave people overwhelmed with new functions\);

18. People learn best when they areallowed/provided spacetomake and correct their own mistakes.Provide test environment;

19. Continuously ask forfeedback from the users;

20. Keep all materials accessible and in compliance with[WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/);
