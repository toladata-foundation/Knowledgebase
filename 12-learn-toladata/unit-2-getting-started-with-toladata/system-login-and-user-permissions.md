## `Exercise`

Register with TolaData at [https://demo-activity.toladata.io](https://demo-activity.toladata.io)**\*** \[Opens a new tab\] and have a browse through your profile.

You’ll see which level of permission you’ve been granted once your Admin assigns programs to you \(you can check that under Team tab of a Program of your choice\).
