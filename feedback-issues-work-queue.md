### **What is a Ticket?**

A ticket could be a report on a specific issue or a problem you are having using the software,  or it could be you have a request for an enhancement to the software. All the tickets are are reviewed, tagged, and prioritized by the TolaData team.

### Our **Work Queue**

The TolaData team monitors the tickets daily. Problems, such as bugs in the software, are usually fixed in the next release of our software.

We will be directly in touch with you with questions regarding your ticket. Requests for enhancements to the software require more feedback from other TolaData users before we can assign our software developers to the ticket.
