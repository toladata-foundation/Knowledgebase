# Add Collected Data

---

This is how you add results data to your indicators to track progress.

Start by going to your Indicators page and find the Indicator you want to add your achieved totals and evidence. If Target is empty, click on the indicator and in the indicator page add your periodic targets at the bottom of the page. Otherwise select your periodic target, your Achieved result/Collected data and add the date the data was collected You can add evidence here by attaching documents from GoogleDrive or directly from Track our in-house repository for raw datasets.

If you have your Evidence dataset in Track refer to the next article for details on how to automatically populate your indicator results.
