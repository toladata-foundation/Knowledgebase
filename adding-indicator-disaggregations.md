# Adding Indicator Disaggregations

Indicator disaggregations can also be added to the system to track your indicator results at different levels. Some common indicator disaggregations are sex, age, location etc.

In TolaData Disaggregations are added in two sections:

* Disaggregation type.This is the name of the indicator disaggregation. You will define and add description of your disaggregations in this section. Example of disaggregation type can be 'Sex'.

* Disaggregation label.These are the labels of your disaggregation type. For example labels for disaggregation type 'Sex' will be 'Male', 'Female'.

Here's how you add them to the system.

Later as you enter your indicator data, your disaggregation will be pre populated in your drop down menu for you to choose from.
