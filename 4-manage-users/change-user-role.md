# Change User Roles

---

It's easy to assign different permission levels to each member of your team. You must be designated as a `Program Admin` in order to change Team Member roles.

There are three types of user roles in the system:

* `Program Admin`
* `Program Team`
* `Program View Only`

| **Operation** | **Program Admin** | **Program Team** | **Program View Only** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |

**Setting team member permissions** (Program Admin Only)

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Team` section.
2. Click `Add Existing Team Member` to select the User your want to add to your team.

Once added, you can change the role of a team member:
