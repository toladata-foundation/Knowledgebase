# Change User Roles

---

It's easy to assign different permission levels to each member of your team. You must be designated as a `Program Admin` in order to change Team Member roles.

There are three types of user roles in the system:

* `Program Admin`
* `Program Team`
* `Program View Only`

| **Operation** | **Program Admin** | **Program Team** | **Program View Only** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Add/edit Team | ![](/assets/fa-check.png) |  |  |
