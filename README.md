A standard set of forms to capture the full data lifecycle of a program, integrating tools like logframe and work-breakdown structures. Each stage of a project is tracked on Activity dashboards, allowing managers and staff to see progress at a glance. Primary forms are supplemented by flexible monitoring forms like training attendance or beneficiary registration.|

The Indicator tracking tool creates indicators at activity, output, outcome, and goal level for each program. Progress against each indicator is documented through data sets from digital data collection tools or a consolidator like Track. Ability to trace evidence-base, view targets vs. actuals, and analyse cost benefit / value for money.
