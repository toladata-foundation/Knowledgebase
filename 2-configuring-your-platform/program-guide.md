### Objectives

**What is a program objective?**

Objectives are specific circumstances to be achieved within a stated time frame that meet a particular goal. Unlike goals, objectives must be measurable to determine progress.

**Why is it important?**

Objectives are necessary to better define the end goal of the program. This helps in measuring and ensuring that meaningful impact is achieved that the program initially set to accomplish.

**Adding program objective**

As part of your country program setup it is helpful to pre populate your program objectives in the system. In general you can find your program objectives in your program proposal or your Logframe.

Here's how to add them to the system:

### Sites

**What is a site?**

A site defines where you are working, the geographical location\(s\) of a program.

**Why capture sites?**

* Sites provide the ability to generate a visualization of our program/project locations on a map.

* It allows teams and managers to monitor performance within a specific location.

* Supports the ability to manage in areas with remote access.

* Over time, it allows teams to track the history of interventions showing how the programming has evolved.

**Adding Sites**

TolaData helps you to capture the following information on program sites:

* Program location name, description, and contact information

* Location latitude and longitude

To add new sites on TolaData go to the Programs tab and click on sites to populate new location information.

### **Stakeholders**

**Who is a stakeholder?**

A stakeholder defines who the program is working with. Stakeholders are people or organizations whether in the public, private or civil sector, whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by a Project Team's decisions, actions, and ensuing results. Examples of stakeholders can be local government offices, institutes, local NGOs, private sector partners etc.

**Why capture stakeholder information?**

* It is a minimum standard and best practice per Program management for development professionals \(PMDPro\) for each program to maintain a Stakeholder Register

* Provides increased coordination across multiple programs

* Documents your work with a stakeholder over time

**Adding Stakeholders**

TolaData provides the option to capture the following information on relevant program stakeholders:

* Stakeholder type

* Contact details

* Supporting documentation: Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\), due diligence, etc.

Stakeholders can be added to through the Stakeholders form under the programs section. And here's how to do it:

**Stakeholder registry**

If stakeholder registry is something you maintain for your organization then this is the place where your add it on TolaData! This helps you to keep track of your stakeholder status and maintain work history log. This helps to maintain continuity in case of staff transition and provide easy access to information on last contact with a stakeholder. The stakeholders created can be added to multiple programs and sites to avoid duplication of information.

### Sector

**What is a sector?**

A sector is a specific thematic area that a program is being implemented in. Common examples of sectors in the humanitarian field are agriculture, healthcare, food security, economic development etc.

**Why capture sector data?**

Linking a program to a single or multiple sector is a great way of classifying your data. As you select or tag a sector to your program you can easily using this as a filter to run different analyses and generate reports.

**Adding sectors**

Sectors are important in tagging and filtering your program by specific themes. Examples of sectors can be health, agriculture, economic development, food security etc. Sectors can be linked to your program and this is how you add it:
