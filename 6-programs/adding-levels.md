# Build your Results Framework

---
As you begin to design your program, one of the first steps you may take is to develop a tree-like diagram to show how you plan to achieve an overall program goal. Once a program goal is defined, you can begin to create branches that break your program goal into more specific, achievable results like Outcomes, Outputs, and eventually Activities contribute to other results in a hierarchical fashion. Once the results are outlined, the results framework is created.

The results framework helps program teams see how each component of the program contributes to the overall program goal. From here, program teams can use the results framework to define indicators to help them measure their results and align program activities to show how they contribute.

**Adding levels to the results framework:**

1. Define the overall program goal. This includes determining the `Level` name (I.e. Goal) and a `Description` statement.

2. Create branches from the overall program goal and define the next set of `Level` names (I.e. Outcome) and its `Description` statements.

3. Continue this process until all your levels are defined and your program results are clearly outlined.
