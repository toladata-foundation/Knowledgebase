# Stakeholders

---

#### Who is a stakeholder?

A stakeholder defines who the program is working with. Stakeholders are people or organizations whether in the public, private or civil sector, whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by a Project Team's decisions, actions, and ensuing results. Examples of stakeholders can be local government offices, institutes, local NGOs, private sector partners etc.

#### Why capture stakeholder information?

* It is a minimum standard and best practice per Program management for development professionals \(PMDPro\) for each program to maintain a Stakeholder Register

* Provides increased coordination across multiple programs

* Documents your work with a stakeholder over time

#### Adding Stakeholders

TolaData provides the option to capture the following information on relevant program stakeholders:

* `Stakeholder Type`

* `Contact Details`

* `Supporting documentation`: Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\), due diligence, etc.

To add stakeholders:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Stakeholder` section.
2. Click, `Add Stakeholder`.
3. Add your stakeholder `Name` (required). Additionally, you can complete the `Sectors`, `Role`, `Type`, and `Country` fields.

> **Tip: Stakeholder registry**

> If your program maintains an existing stakeholder registry, the stakeholder section is where this data can be mapped to. This helps you to keep track of your stakeholder status and maintain work history log in case of staff transition, this section can help provide easy access to information on last contact with a stakeholder. The stakeholders created can be added to multiple programs and sites to avoid duplication of information.
