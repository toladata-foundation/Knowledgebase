#### What is a Program?

A **program** is defined as a group of related projects and or activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available through managing them individually.

Most program details can be found in program proposals and concept notes developed in your program's proposal development and setup and planning phases. 

Here's an example of how `programs`, `projects` and `activities` can be broken down:

**Adding a new program**

To add a new program for your team or organization, go to the `Programs` tab and click `Add New Program`. Start by adding your `Program Name`, `Start date`, and `End date`. Click `Submit` and you're all set!

From here you will prompted to the `Program Guide` to help you start adding information about your program in the following sections:

* `Sectors`

* `Results Framework`

* `Indicator plan`

* Any `data collection forms` you would be using for tracking your indicators

> **Tip:** Donâ€™t worry if you cannot complete all the details here! You can always go back later to complete any of the sections at your own pace. :relaxed:
