TolaData organizes the data structure as follows:![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bwSILTkbduz5k-J306Xz2yn7YbL5VCYMCSNsrjglnWkfjm8Tt1xwLXlStAH6UYO2IHLB7iE2S8tqMl3YozH6zNJe-To86Tv_oOXXBnG-YSNen6Z_UuLLFBMBax6Xk66ZCBsNYejo)

The country or portfolio level data are a group of related programs tagged together.

To create a country or portfolio level please contact us directly at [support@toladata.com](mailto:support@toladata.com) for us to setup your own country or portfolio instance.

### Program

**Adding a new program**

To add a new program for your team or organization, go to the `Programs` tab and click `Add New Program`. Start by adding your `Program Name`, `Start date`, and `End date`. Click `Submit` and you're all set!

From here you will prompted to the `Program Guide` to help you start adding information about your program in the following sections:

* `Sectors`

* `Results Framework`

* `Indicator plan`

* Any `data collection forms` you would be using for tracking your indicators

> **Tip:** Donâ€™t worry if you cannot complete all the details here! You can always go back later to complete any of the sections at your own pace. :relaxed:

### Sites

**What is a site?**

A site defines where you are working, the geographical location\(s\) of a program.

**Why capture sites?**

* Sites provide the ability to generate a visualization of our program/project locations on a map.

* It allows teams and managers to monitor performance within a specific location.

* Supports the ability to manage in areas with remote access.

* Over time, it allows teams to track the history of interventions showing how the programming has evolved.

**Adding sites**

TolaData helps you to capture the following information on site locations:

* `Program Location Name`, `Description`, and `Contact Information`

* `Location`, `Latitude` and `Longitude`

To add sites:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Sites` section.
2. Click, `Add a Site`.
3. Fill out the relevant fields for your site. Required field are `Site Name` and `Country`.

> **Tip:** If you don't have exact latitude and longitude coordinates for your site, you can find it by using the pin on the map to drop it in the location of your site. Be sure to select `Country` first to zoom the map first.

### Milestones

**What is a milestone?**

Milestones are markers that you can use to identify key accomplishments throughout the life of your program. One use case for milestones is to mark the start and end of a program phase as below:

**Why is it important?**  
Milestones can help us break the program lifecycle into phases making it easier to see how a program progresses over time. With Milestones, the system will be able to summarize all program activities that are completed during the defined milestone start and end dates.

**Adding milestones**

To add milestones:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Milestones` section.
2. Click, `Add a Milestone`.
3. Add your milestone `Name`, `Start Date``End Date` (required). Additionally, you can add a `Description`.

### Objectives

**What is an objective?**

Objectives are specific circumstances to be achieved within a stated time frame that meet a particular goal. Unlike goals, objectives must be measurable to determine progress.

**Why is it important?**

Objectives are necessary to better define the end goal of the program. This helps in measuring and ensuring that meaningful impact is achieved that the program intended to accomplish.

**Adding objectives**

To add objectives:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Objectives` section.
2. Under `Strategic Objectives`, Click, `Add`.
3. Add your objective `Name` and `Description`.
4. After you associate indicators to your objectives, you will see them displayed here.

Under the `Programs` tab..

> **Tip:** As part of the program setup it is helpful to add objectives in the system early on. Objectives can typically be found in your program proposal or your Logframe.

### **Stakeholders**

**Who is a stakeholder?**

A stakeholder defines who the program is working with. Stakeholders are people or organizations whether in the public, private or civil sector, whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by a Project Team's decisions, actions, and ensuing results. Examples of stakeholders can be local government offices, institutes, local NGOs, private sector partners etc.

**Why capture stakeholder information?**

* It is a minimum standard and best practice per Program management for development professionals \(PMDPro\) for each program to maintain a Stakeholder Register

* Provides increased coordination across multiple programs

* Documents your work with a stakeholder over time

**Adding Stakeholders**

TolaData provides the option to capture the following information on relevant program stakeholders:

* `Stakeholder Type`

* `Contact Details`

* `Supporting documentation`: Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\), due diligence, etc.

To add stakeholders:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Stakeholder` section.
2. Click, `Add Stakeholder`.
3. Add your stakeholder `Name` (required). Additionally, you can complete the `Sectors`, `Role`, `Type`, and `Country` fields.

> **Tip: Stakeholder registry**

> If your program maintains an existing stakeholder registry, the stakeholder section is where this data can be mapped to. This helps you to keep track of your stakeholder status and maintain work history log in case of staff transition, this section can help provide easy access to information on last contact with a stakeholder. The stakeholders created can be added to multiple programs and sites to avoid duplication of information.

### Sectors

**What is a sector?**

A sector is a specific thematic area that a program is being implemented in. Common examples of sectors in the humanitarian field are agriculture, healthcare, food security, economic development etc.

**Why capture sector data?**

Linking a program to a single or multiple sector is a great way of classifying your data. As you select or tag a sector to your program you can easily use this as a filter to run different analyses and generate reports. Examples of sectors are: health, agriculture, economic development, food security.

**Adding sectors**

Sectors can be linked to your program and this is how you add it:

To add sectors:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Sectors` section.
2. To start, add a primary sector by clicking, `Add Primary`.
3. Scroll through the list or use the filter option to find your sector from pre-existing list. If you want to add your own, click `Add Custom Sector`. 
4. Once your `Primary Sector` is selected, you can select `Secondary Sectors` to better define what your program does.
5. You can repeat these steps to add multiple `Primary Sectors` and `Secondary Sectors`.

> **Tip:** Notice in some cases when you select a `Primary Sector`, there are `Secondary Sectors` that are already selected. This happens as the system learns what Primary Sectors and Secondary Sectors are associated by users in the organization, the system will begin to suggest relevant sectors. Hopefully this will speed up the process! :nerd_face:
