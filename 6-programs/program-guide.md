### Program

**Adding a new program**

To add a new program for your team or organization, go to the `Programs` tab and click `Add New Program`. Start by adding your `Program Name`, `Start date`, and `End date`. Click `Submit` and you're all set!

From here you will prompted to the `Program Guide` to help you start adding information about your program in the following sections:

* `Sectors`

* `Results Framework`

* `Indicator plan`

* Any `data collection forms` you would be using for tracking your indicators

> **Tip:** Donâ€™t worry if you cannot complete all the details here! You can always go back later to complete any of the sections at your own pace. :relaxed:
