# What is a Results Framework?

---

|  Definition | A results framework is an explicit articulation \(graphic display, matrix, or summary\) of the different levels, or chains, of results expected from a particular intervention—project, program, or development strategy. |

The results specified typically comprise the longer-term objectives\(often referred to as “outcomes” or “impact”\) and the intermediate outcomes and outputs that precede, and lead to, those desired longer-term objectives.

Some of the benefits of using a results framework:

* It helps focus on specific outcomes. 

* It highlights the key linkages in the theory of change that underpin the intervention. 

* It helps establish an evidence-based approach to monitoring and evaluation. 

* It helps measure progress toward strategic objectives.

* It helps achieve strategic objectives.
