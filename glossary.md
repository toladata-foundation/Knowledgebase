#### **Activity**

Equivalent to a major deliverable, several projects may contribute towards realizing one activity within a program.

#### **Dashboard**

Offers you a transparent, dynamic view of the data associated with your work at the country, program, and project level. Dashboards can be used to make management decisions as well as a location to track your progress.

#### **Indicator**

This Tola module allows teams to track all program indicators and their targets vs. actuals in real-time dashboards.

#### **Program**

Defined as any open, active grants that appear in GAIT. As grants close in GAIT, the historical data of that program will be stored in Tola.

#### **Project**

The hands-on work staff, partners, sub-grantees, and contractors do on a day to day basis.

#### Results Framework

#### **Tola**

A Pashtun word for “all” or “complete”— is used by us as all or complete data.

#### **TolaData**

An open-source software built by Mercy Corps HQ IT team along with the Mercy Corps Afghanistan teatm. Tola improves how we evaluate program data by providing adaptable tools that support the things we learn from experience.

#### Activity **Workflow**

This Tola module is comprised of standard forms that support project management workflow.

#### **Unique Columns**

A Unique Column is any column in your Tola Table that does not have the same data in any of its rows; each row in the column is unique and does not repeat.  For example User IDs or Serial Numbers are good examples of unique data. Tables imported from services like Ona will usually have a Column called uu\_id which is a universal unique id. The uu-id column is a great column to assign as your Unique Column.  Assigning a Unique Column in Tola Tables will ensure that only new data is added to your Table when you turn on Auto-Pull or choose to manually Update a table in Tola Tables.
