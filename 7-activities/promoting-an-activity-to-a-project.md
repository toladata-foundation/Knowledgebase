# Project vs. Activity

---

#### Turning Projects into Activities
When you are project planning, there are cases when you need to break down your projects into more manageable activities. 

Activities are simply created by dragging and dropping a Project under another. This creates an activity that is still related to the Project.

Here's how to do it:

1. Hover over a Project
2. Select a Project and drag it from left to right under another Project.
3. Release it and the project is now an Activity.

> **Tip**: 
Currently, only one level of Activities is supported.
