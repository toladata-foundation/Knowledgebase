# What is an Activity?

---

This section is focused on capturing all the activities to be completed under your program. This is similar to your program workplan sometimes referred to as the 'Work breakdown structure \(WBS\)' or 'Detailed implementation plan'.

Here's a quick revision of where activities fall on TolaData data structure:

A great place for you to start will be looking at your program workplan to breakdown your program projects and activities. Here's an example of a how projects and activities can be broken down in a program:

### **Key information captured in this section**

* Estimated activity timeline: start and end date

* Estimated budget

* Sub-activites/tasks breakdown

* Anticipated impact / results

* Description of Deliverables

* Risks and issues

### Why capture activity related information?

Key activity progress information is required to report program success. Here are some reasons why activity progress data can be helpful:

* Easy access to activity progress data to internal management and donor

* Real-time results information help to make mid-course corrections capture lessons and issues.

* Documents key components of a project providing traceability of evidence
