## **Why TolaData**

'Why TolaData' is a question you will have answer when you try to onboard your team to start using TolaData. Here are a couple of pointers to keep in mind when trying to demonstration the value of TolaData.

Benefits of using TolaData:

* \_End-to-end solution for your program management process.\_You don't have to worry about using different tools to manage all your program and monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\) data. TolaData provides an end-to-end solution for your entire program life cycle and manage the workflow process.

* _Traceability and accessibility of program data._ Remember how every time you have to report to donors or senior management you have struggle to look for program progress data? Now all your program data are neatly aligned with measurable indicators and progress tracking indicator results is just click away! Your survey and monitoring data are also traceable directly to your indicator results.

* Flexible to integrate with existing system. If you are in the development sector for a long time, chances are you are already using many of the data management and monitoring tools. TolaData offers easy integration with any tools with external API so your data can be easily migrated from existing system.

* Community led.TolaData uses a bottom up approach in designing the platform. It focuses on gathering feedback and enhancement requests directly from the users by maintaining an open user community to engage with each other.
