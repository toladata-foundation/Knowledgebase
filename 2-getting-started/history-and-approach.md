# History

---

TolaData started its journey in 2016 but there were some key events that influenced its development.

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| History of Project Forms | Standard project forms were developed with nearly 20 years of field testing from various country contexts and emergency crises around the globe. They were used and adapted by country offices headquarter staff which allowed these forms to be refined, standardized, and reused. |
| Mission Metrics | In 2010, an Agency initiative focused on rolling up indicators by aggregating results and aligning it to our mission. However, system started to overburden field who saw it as extra work to their direct field needs and business case for a system began to show mixed results |
| Focused on Indicator Results | In 2014, the agency began to look at developing an agency-wide indicator results tracking system after previous attempts at building an agency measurement system. They began a build versus buy assessment across field needs which included pilot testing major off-the-shelf solutions at the time. |
| Afghanistan | While this was happening at the agency-level, Afghanistan began to test the ability to scale the standard project forms across the country office by digitizing them and linking with a relational database. |
| Remote monitoring | We began introducing mobile data collection for all survey data across the country office to take advantage of near real-time data for remote monitoring and creation of interactive dashboards and customized reports for our donors and key stakeholders. As this stage, we were able to demonstrate the end-to-end solution of the data lifecycle. |
| Introducing TolaData | By 2016, TolaData was rolled out across the country office and began to scale to other countries in the Middle East region. Later that year, it was adopted as the agency-level program management and M&E system. |

# Approach

TolaDataâ€™s approach utilizes the power of cloud-based technologies to improve program monitoring efforts. This means our platform allows you to sync data seamlessly regardless of your internet connectivity status. Harnessing existing mobile technology provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional paper and pencil data collection methods, and by conducting surveys using tablets or even mobile phones, data collection times are reduced and beneficiary verification is improved.

Once data has been collected, TolaData blends it with simple workflow tools and a centralized database to allow for customized reporting that can integrate with third party software with low maintenance costs.
