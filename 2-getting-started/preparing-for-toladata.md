# Are you TolaData Ready?

---

At its core, TolaData supports teams in monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\) and Program Management by establishing practices and processes that promote improved data quality.

One of the key success factors to adopting TolaData is investing in the preparation prior to going live with the system. Below, we provide guidance on M&E and program management practices that can help you prepare.

---

This guidance is broken up into **three tiers**: minimum requirements, best practices, and self assessment.

* **Tier I**: _Minimum requirements_, are those things that must be in place before an organization is ready for a rollout of TolaData.

* **Tier II**: _Best practices_, is a list of tools, practices, and skill sets that make an organization better prepared and equipped for adopting TolaData.

* **Tier III**: _Team Self-Assessment_, is a set of questions to assess the current state of a teamâ€™s processes, procedures, capacity, and what type of support a team will need for rollout.

These three tiers of readiness will help the TolaData team develop a rollout plan might need to be adapted for a specific team's needs, and what kind of support will be required to ensure a successful implementation of the system.

---

## TIER I: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

* Team leadership buy-in including Program and M&E leads
* Dedicated organization administrator and in-country resources for onboarding and support
* Staff time commitment toward preparations to go-live and post-training support

## TIER II: BEST PRACTICES

While best practices are not mandatory for TolaData, some organizations have found that adopting these proceedings can help prepare teams to be more equipped and ready to take advantage of a more connected data workflow. Having the below mentioned qualities will help your team become successful TolaData champions!

* **Digital data collection:** the use of digital data collection tools as applicable and relevant, authoring XLS forms, and adoption of third-party service provider like [Ona](https://ona.io/) or [Kobo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/).
* **Cloud-based document storage:** documents are accessible in a digital format within a standard folder structure for retaining documents and basic understanding of tools like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/).
* **Adopt common program management practices:** Familiarity with Program Management standards like [PMDPro](http://www.pm4ngos.com/the-guide-to-the-pmd-pro/) or [PRINCE2](https://www.prince2.com/uk/what-is-prince2) can be helpful for teams.
* **Standard indicators** are in use for existing programs where relevant and included in new proposals \(alongside budgets for proper measurement and collection\).
* **Standard collection and monitoring tools:** data collection tools \(recording and reporting tools\) in any format \(paper or digital\), standard formats for logframes or indicator plans.
* **Standard organizational-level key performance indicators \(KPI\):** KPIs that can be aggregated across multiple programs M&E and ICT/Information Management requirements and responsibilities are articulated in all key program positions \(program delivery, M&E, operations, etc\).
* **M&E and data quality:** is prioritized as part of organizational strategies or annual plans.
