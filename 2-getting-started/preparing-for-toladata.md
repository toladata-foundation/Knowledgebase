# Get most out of TolaData!

---

At its core, TolaData supports teams in monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\) and Program Management by establishing practices and processes that promote improved data quality.

One of the key success factors to adopting TolaData is investing in the preparation prior to going live with the system. Below, we provide guidance on M&E and program management practices that can help you prepare.

---

This guidance is broken up into **two tiers**: minimum requirements and best practices.

* **Tier I**: _Minimum requirements_, are those things that are in place before a team is ready to use TolaData.

* **Tier II**: _Best practices_, is a list of tools and practices that make a team more prepared and equipped for adopting TolaData.

* **Tier III**: _Team Self-Assessment_, is a set of questions to assess teamâ€™s current processes, procedures, capacity, and type of support a team will need for rollout.

These tiers of readiness will help the TolaData team develop an onboarding plan that meets your team's specific needs, and the level of support required to ensure a successful implementation of the system.
