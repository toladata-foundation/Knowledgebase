# Are you TolaReady?

---

At its core, TolaData requires teams to have a strong foundation for monitoring and evaluation \(M&E\), have program management in place and practices/processes established that promote data quality. 

Depending on the current capacity of the country team, the preparation to be TolaData ready, prior to actually rolling out the system, can be the bulk of the work. This would include supporting teams to improve their M&E and program management practices.

This guidance is broken up into three tiers: minimum requirements, best practices, and self assessment.

* Tier I: Minimum requirements, are those things that must be in place before an organization is ready for a rollout of TolaData.

* Tier II: Best practices, is a list of tools, practices, and skill sets that make an organization better prepared and equipped for adopting the TolaData system.

* Tier III: Organization Self-Assessment, is a set of questions to assess the current state of a country’s processes, procedures, capacity, and what type of support an organization will need for rollout.

These three tiers of “readiness” will help the TolaData team make decisions about how a roll out plan might need to be adapted _**for a specific country team**_, and what kind of support will be required to ensure a successful implementation of the system.

## TIER I: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

* Organizational leadership buy-in including by program managers and M&E leads.
* Dedicated organization administrator and in-country resources for onboarding and support.
* Staff time commitment toward preparations to go-live and post-training support.

## TIER II: BEST PRACTICES

While best practices are not mandatory for TolaData, some organizations have found that adopting these practices can help prepare teams to be more equipped and ready to take advantage of a more connected data workflow. Having the below mentioned qualities will help your team become successful TolaData champions!

* **Digital data collection:** the use of digital data collection tools as applicable and relevant, authoring XLS forms, and adoption of third-party service provider like [Ona](https://ona.io/) or [Kobo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/).
* **Cloud-based document storage:** documents are accessible in a digital format within a standard folder structure for retaining documents and basic understanding of tools like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/).
* **Adopt common program management practices:** Familiarity with Program Management standards like [PMDPro](http://www.pm4ngos.com/the-guide-to-the-pmd-pro/) or [PRINCE2](https://www.prince2.com/uk/what-is-prince2) can be helpful for teams.
* **Standard indicators** are in use for existing programs where relevant and included in new proposals \(alongside budgets for proper measurement and collection\).
* **Standard collection and monitoring tools:** data collection tools \(recording and reporting tools\) in any format \(paper or digital\), standard formats for logframes or indicator plans. 
* **Standard organizational-level key performance indicators \(KPI\):** KPIs that can be aggregated across multiple programs M&E and ICT/Information Management requirements and responsibilities are articulated in all key program positions \(program delivery, M&E, operations, etc\).
* **M&E and data quality:** is prioritized as part of organizational strategies or annual plans
