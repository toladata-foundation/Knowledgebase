#### Project

#### Results Framework

A results framework is a graphical display or matrix of the different levels of results expected from a particular program. The results comprise of the longer-term objectives \('outcomes' or 'impact'\) and the intermediate outcomes and outputs.

#### Tola

A Pashtun word for “all” or “complete” — is used by us at TolaData to mean "complete data".

#### TolaData

An open-source project and data management software.

#### Tola Activity

**Activity** is TolaData’s program management toolkit, comprises a collection of data forms, reports and visualizations designed to track results of your NGO’s programs and projects.

#### Tola Track

**Track**, TolaData’s database management toolkit, enables you to easily consolidate multiple data sources for timely analysis.

#### Unique Columns

A Unique Column is any column in your TolaTables that does not have the same data in any of its rows; each row in the column is unique and does not repeat.  For example User IDs or Serial Numbers are good examples of unique data. Tables imported from services like Ona will usually have a Column called uu\_id which is a universal unique id. The uu-id column is a great column to assign as your Unique Column.  Assigning a Unique Column in Tola Tables will ensure that only new data is added to your Table when you turn on Auto-Pull or choose to manually Update a table in Tola Tables.
