# **Mobile Data Collection **

---

Mobile Data Collection or MDC, is the use of mobile devices from low-end mobile phones to notebooks, to simplify the collection of data in the field.   
It can turn out as being very useful to the evaluator for e.g. when collecting data or abstracting data for an evaluation.



_**Additional requirements**_:   
It is not enough to simply have the device - be it a phone, a tablet or a notebook - those devices require applications \(so called platforms\) to allow users to capture  monitoring and evaluation data.

But before we go to the usage of the MDC devices and the platforms required, you should **figure out whether or not MDC is appropriate for your project/s**. 

Following are a couple of aspects you should keep in mind when considering using Mobile Data Collection:

* **Data needs**: MDC is good for quantitative data collection and less for qualitative data such as long texts
* **Connectivity**: Network coverage may not be important when collecting the data but it is when it comes to transmitting the data to a central database. 
* **Consider lifespan**: you would like to invest into devices that may hold for a longer amount of time. For that it is important for you to know if the devices you purchase will be useful for further projects in the future.
* **Security risks of sending data**: if send through a data network, the platform encryption will be secure. This is not forcefully the case when sending SMS.

Here a couple of arguments in favor of using mobile devices for data gathering:

_**Advantages:**_

* **Design the survey** following your needs
* **Makes managing the data collection process easier** through real time submissions 
* **It reduces costs** associated with printing, form transportation, double entry of data required though digitalizing the data captured by pen on paper in the field, cleansing tasks and therethrough **labour**
* **Easily capture other forms of data** such as photographs, information from list section, voice recordings, GPS coordinates etc. 
* **Makes entering and aggregating data easier** 
* **Easier to carry out subsequent data reviews and cleansing tasks**

 Some examples:   
> 1\) **Catholic Relief Services** have been able to **cut the labor in half** in conducing seed affairs, by using touch devices and bar code technology identify beneficiary and seed vendors and track the exchange of goods.
>
> 2\) **Pact** in Namibia wanted to conduct an evaluation of capacity development with partners during their project. Mobile technology facilitated the collection of the evaluation of data by allowing to **design** the appropriate survey for the task, by giving the chance for **data upload by the ones collecting it** and lastly by **making the data collection very fast**: it was available one week later for the required analysis and report.
