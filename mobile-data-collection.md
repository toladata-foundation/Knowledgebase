# **Mobile Data Collection **

---

Mobile Data Collection or MDC, is the use of mobile devices from low-end mobile phones to notebooks, to simplify the collection of data in the field.  
It can turn out as being very useful to the evaluator for e.g. when collecting data or abstracting data for an evaluation.

_**Additional requirements**_:  
It is not enough to simply have the device - be it a phone, a tablet or a notebook - those devices require applications \(so called platforms\) to allow users to capture  monitoring and evaluation data.



But before we go to the usage of the MDC devices and the platforms required, you should first of all figure out: 

_**Is** **MDC is appropriate for your project/s?**_

_Following are a couple of aspects you should keep in mind when considering using Mobile Data Collection:_

* **Data needs**: MDC is good for quantitative data collection and less for qualitative data such as long texts
* **Connectivity**: Network coverage may not be important when collecting the data but it is when it comes to transmitting the data to a central database. 
* **Consider lifespan**: you would like to invest into devices that may hold for a longer amount of time. For that it is important for you to know if the devices you purchase will be useful for further projects in the future.
* **Security risks of sending data**: if send through a data network, the platform encryption will be secure. This is not forcefully the case when sending SMS.

Here a couple of arguments in favor of using mobile devices for data gathering:

_**Advantages:**_

| **Design the survey** following needs of project |
| :--- |
| **Easier to manage the data collection process** through real time submissions |
| **Reduces costs** associated with: printing, form transportation, cleansing tasks |
| **Reduces labour** by: cutting the double entry of data by having to digitalize the data captured by pen on paper in the field |
| **Easier to enter and aggregate data**  |
| **Easier to carry out** subsequent **data reviews** and **cleansing tasks** |

Some examples:

> 1\) **Catholic Relief Services** have been able to **cut the labor in half** in conducing seed affairs, by using touch devices and bar code technology identify beneficiary and seed vendors and track the exchange of goods.
>
> 2\) **Pact** in Namibia wanted to conduct an evaluation of capacity development with partners during their project. Mobile technology facilitated the collection of the evaluation of data by allowing to **design** the appropriate survey for the task, by giving the chance for **data upload by the ones collecting it** and lastly by **making the data collection very fast**: it was available one week later for the required analysis and report.

_**What good applications/platforms allow you to do:**_** **

* entry data in an offline mode
* transmit data automatically to a central database once a communication network is available 
* offer ability to validate data as it's entered 
* remember previously entered data to reduce complexity of data entry
* capacity to collect multiple forms of data: photographs, voice recordings, GPS coordinates etc.
